# This Week I Learned more about visual studio (10/12/18)

---

In visual studio code, I learned how to copy and past pictures into GitHub correctly. If you were to past a photo into GitHub first, you would need to find a photo. Once you have your photo, you will need to copy and paste the photo's URL, not the websites it posted on so that the visual studio will be able to find the picture. Once you have the photo, you will need to paste the URL in between two parentheses. Above you pasted URL, you then need to out a name for the picture in brackets and add an exclamation point at the end and send it to GitHub.

# This Week I learned Git 10/05/18

This week I learned how to code on Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a free Microsoft application that we are using in class as our way to create a website. Visual Studio Code also works like a google doc in that a team of individuals can band together and write a program. The issue with this is that when separate developers merge a project, the projects will typically not sit well together and will require assistance to fix the problem. If working individually a programmer needs to first press ctr+s, commit, set a message, and then press sync. Unlike google drive where changes will upload automatically, Visual Studio Code requires the programmer to press Sync for it to update to the network

# This week I learned ----9/7/2018: 6 sentences on what you learned 

Tuesday: Sold state drives use energy as information if this drive was to sit on a shelf for two-three years the information will lose energy and will become unusable. 
Wednesday: Alen Turing created the Turing machine--- 
Thursday: Algorithms: a set of instructions that solve a question--- 
Types of Algorithms [Binary Seach, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort]--- 
[Constant] O(1) = Y = 1 One input that's how long it will take 
[Logrithmic] O(Log(n)) = Gets faster as n increases 
[Linear] O(n) = What N is that's how long it will take 
[Polytime] O(n^2) Takes more time as you add more to do. 
[Exponetial]O(n^n) Whatever n is n is raised to that power

# Computer Networking 9/14/18

This Week I learned that htp is the old standard way of sending information and post-2008 most computers moved to https that was a secure way of sending information over the internet. I learned what LAN vs. WAN LAN being local area network that is emitted from the local router. While the WAN is part of the ISP and connects to other WAN's to create a computer network. across the world On top of that, you do not have to be in the same room city or region to connect to these networks. You can use VPN to connect to a network but your information will be sent to the VPN and their servers and will then be sent back down the chain. Finally,  packets that transmit information via electronic pulses.

# Cryptography 9/21/18

This week i learned about cryptography the art of concealing information over a public line. Cryptography is used by governments, and companies to hide important information such as credit card info, social security numbers, or military quardinants. Cryptogrphy uses codes and these codes require cyphers. Cyphers such as Ceasar shift were the sender will shift  the alphabet over 1 to 25 times. Other types of encryption would be ATBASH were the encrypter switchs all the letters in the alphabet with its opposite in the line. An example of ATBASH would be A=Z, C=X, B=Y. Finally their is morse code were the sender sends a series of dots and dashes that reresent letters.
